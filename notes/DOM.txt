2. Lifecycle DOM Events

2.1) DOMContentLoaded event của document
=> As soon as the HTML is completely parsed.
( which mean the HTML has been downloaded and been convert to the DOM tree.
Also all scripts must be downloaded and executed before the DOMContentLoaded happen.)
=> This event does actually NOT wait for images and other external resources (CSS) to load
=> Just HTML and Javascript need to be loaded
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', nameFunction);

2.2) load event của window
=> After the HTML is completely parsed and also the images, external resources finish
window.addEventListener('load',nameFunction);

2.3) beforeunload của window
=> Before you want to leave the website, it will have the alert to ask you confirm to leave
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.returnValue = '';
});
